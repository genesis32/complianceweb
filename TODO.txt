# Implement ServiceAccount list for GCP
# Implement ServiceAccount key delete for GCP
# Error codes instead of strings being returned from service.
# Way to update role for GCP service account
# Add another resource type (perhaps aws service account)?
# See if we can get implicit openid grant working for auth0 and maybe okta?
# Make sure our audit events log json
# Database encryption of sensitive fields (cookies, gcp credentials, etc)
# Most likely need to base64 encode gcpCredentials metadata
# Add a production test to make sure we don't accept jwts that aren't signed.
# Implement dual control for 1 resource type (perhaps gcp service account create)
# Start planning what a front-end application may look like.
# Generate invite code from cli and use jwt in a request in invite code to create user.
# Configurable amount of time before invites are purged.
# Remove ability for Organizational Admin to modify his own roles (except when maybe under bootstrap mode?)
# Maybe we should expose the core primitives of the services for all the responses.
# Pubsub event emitter?
# Would be kind of cool if you could put together some data in this app and then output it to ladon policies:
  https://github.com/ory/ladon
# Add a dual control method to AWS iam.

DONE
- Assign roles to gcp service account
- Looks interesting: https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/reference/credentials/rest/v1/projects.serviceAccounts
- Remove front-end cruft from the old version.
- A README
k Deployable in Docker

BUGS
# Nice error message when you've already registered an account. [right now it dies]

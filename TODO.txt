# Implement ServiceAccount list for GCP
# Implement ServiceAccount key delete for GCP
# Way to update role for GCP service account
# Add another resource type (perhaps aws service account)?
# See if we can get implicit openid grant working for auth0 and maybe okta?
# Make sure our audit events log json
# Database encryption of sensitive fields (cookies, gcp credentials, etc)
# Add a production test to make sure we don't accept jwts that aren't signed.
# Implement dual control for 1 resource type (perhaps gcp service account create)
# Start planning what a front-end application may look like.
# Generate invite code from cli
# Most likely need to base64 encode gcpCredentials metadata
